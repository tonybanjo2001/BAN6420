Salary Data Processing Assignment An Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and an R script to perform various tasks related to data processing, error handling, and file handling using Python and R. The tasks include importing salary data, creating a function to retrieve employee details, processing the data into a dictionary, implementing error handling, exporting employee details to a CSV file within a zipped folder, and unzipping and displaying the data using R.

SalaryDataProcessing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data processing tasks.
unzip_display.R: R script to unzip the folder and display the employee data.

You need to install pip install pandas because I did not have that on mine
Launch Jupyter Notebook from VS code

Import data in CSV from the right directory. The file path should be updated in the notebook if necessary.

execute the Notebook:

Run each cell sequentially to perform the following tasks:
Import the salary data.
Create a function to retrieve employee details.
Process the salary data into a dictionary.
Implement error handling.
Export employee details to a CSV file and zip it into the "Employee Profile" folder.



Run the R Script:

Place the Employee_Profile.zip file in the same directory as unzip_display.R. (although I struggled to get it done)
Open R or RStudio and run the unzip_display.R script: =========source('unzip_display.R')
